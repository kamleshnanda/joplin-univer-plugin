# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document specifies the requirements for a Joplin plugin that integrates Univer spreadsheet functionality. The plugin will replace the deprecated LuckySheets-based JSheets plugin with a modern, open-source spreadsheet solution that provides Excel-like features within Joplin notes. The plugin must support formula calculations, data persistence across Dropbox syncs, and seamless integration with Joplin's note editing experience.
